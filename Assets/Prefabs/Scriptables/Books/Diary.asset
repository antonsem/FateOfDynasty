    "This
    is it... I''m the last member. The movement will be dead soon enough. We did
    come very close. Reese did have the blood sample. And it even was clean, non-coagulated.
    The ritual would have been perfect...


    My only hope is that someone else
    will discover the secret. Otherwise the Dynasty will rule forever. They cannot
    be overthrown by a revolution, or propoganda. Lord know we tried...

    I
    know I was the last person you expected to do this. But don''t worry Jeremiah,
    I will do the right thing.'
