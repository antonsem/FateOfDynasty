  use: This book goes on and on about how important it is to be a mother. It claims
    that a mother has the most crucial role in modern society. A mother. Not a woman.
    Not a person. A mother. Don't I matter just because I don't have a child? Should
    my only purpose be to bring and raise an offspring to this world?
