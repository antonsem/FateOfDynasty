  use: Ah yes, The Mighty Dynasty. We are the best! "God himself gave us the right
    to rule!" So, we can rule however we like, is that it? All the wars and poverty
    are acceptable so long as we are in power. People are supposed to make sacrifices
    for us. "God created them to serve us!" I can't believe we were indoctrinating
    ourselves with such lies, and delusions for this long.
