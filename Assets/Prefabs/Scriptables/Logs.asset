  use: I can't light it up just with a candle. But I will pick one, perhaps I can
    find a way to do it. I should look around, I'm sure there is something in this
    laboratory that can be used as fuel.
  used: I already have a log. I need to find some kind of fuel to light it up.
  description: Logs for the fireplace. I don't think I can set them on fire only
    with a candle...
